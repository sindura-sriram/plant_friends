# Code README
This is where you can document your design decisions, known bugs, and instructions to run your code.

_Please remove the example code files `file_1.py`, `file_2.py`, and `file_3.py`, and replace them with your own code._

### Design Decisions ###
You can use sections to organize your work.

### Instructions ###
Or even sub-sections!
