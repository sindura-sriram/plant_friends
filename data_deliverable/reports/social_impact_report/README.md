# Socio-historical Context and Impact Report

### Socio-historical Context ###
One key idea to look at is the current place of smaller farmers within the crop business. All across the world, smaller farmers are being pushed out by larger corporations, both via the economic power of the bigger companies, but also via changing government policies. One example of a recent policy change that hurts small farmers is India where smaller farmers might be hurt by new laws that circumvent the wholesale system that provides an integral safety net, one farmer states in an interview: "This is a death warrant for small and marginalised farmers. This is aimed at destroying them by handing over agriculture and market to the big corporates. They want to snatch away our land. But we will not let them do this" (BBC). This issue also points to who the major stakeholders might be for our project: small farmers, as well as larger private corporations. Our project may reveal high yield areas in land owned by small farmers, giving larger corporations reasons to push them out (ethically or not). Or, the project could reveal low yield areas to corporations, who could then sell the land to unsuspecting farmers at an unfair price.

The current research on this problem has determined that increased temperatures over time have corresponded with decreased yield of plants across 4 independent estimates: wheat, rice, maize, and soybeans. (Zhao et. al) It's difficult to directly match the findings to any one societal impact, but the most likely area of impact is in the broad-scale worry about climate change. More data corroborating the dangers of the Earth's increasing temperature likely added more fuel onto the fire in regards to peoples fears, but whether or not it spurred any governments or corporations into action is yet to be seen. We expect our project to show similar results, and so it may have a similar impact in terms of the climate change discussion. Looking at the potential impacts, both on farmers and on the issue of climate change, it's important that we present our data more broadly, and frame the issue as a global one rather than a regional one. Regionally, the data could be used for short-term gains and exhaustion of fertile resources, but if we frame the problem globally, we can begin to see what's more important: taking care of our planet 

### Ethical Considerations ###
The data collected on plant yield is collected over satellite, which could be considered to be an invasion of privacy, although there do not currently exist any privacy protections when it comes to satellites. Certain individuals like farmers or planners could be personally affected by the collection and analysis of plant yield data; for instance, a learned prediction that overestimated a region's plant growth serve to financially ruin farmers whose yields does not match those of the model's. This could be for many reasons; it could be that our model is simply not robust enough, or it could be that the methods of collecting data are themselves unreliable. A study in the accuracy of vegetation surveys found that observer error was a pervasive component of all vegetation sampling including human observers, could this inaccuracy be true of data collected via satellite as well? Does our data account for a margin of observer error, due to reasons such as error due to satellite orbit? Assuming that our data is accurately represented can lead to unexamined biases in our analysis.

Another important consideration that we will not likely be able to quantify is the extent to which climate bias in collection sampling influences model outcomes. A 2008 paper found that climate bias did not significantly affection distribution predictions for yield when compared with an unbiased dataset; rather, these researchers found that the greatest factor behind a model's performance was the number of data points used to train the data. Nevertheless, climate bias is a variable that we must acknowledge as an underlying bias that could affect our data. We can mitigate this bias by both acknowledging the presence of climate bias in our analysis and also following the findings of the 2008 paper and prioritize the size of our training set. We are also having to be careful about assumptions we make about our data that might influence our decision-making. In preparing the data for this deliverable, we found that there were entries with missing data regarding plant yield. We chose to regard missing data as indicating "crop was not grown here at all" and a 0 as "crop is grown here but had 0 yield". We also opted for sources that had data over large regions, rather than sources that may have had extensive data specific to certain regions. All of these assumptions in deciding where to source and how to read our data could affect our final analysis, as we may be finding results generalized over large regions rather than patters specific to certain regions.
